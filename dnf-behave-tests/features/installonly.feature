Feature: Test upgrading installonly packages


Background:
  Given I use the repository "dnf-ci-fedora"
    And I set config option "installonly_limit" to "2"


Scenario: Setup (install the first installonly package)
   When I execute dnf with args "install kernel-core"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | kernel-core-0:4.18.16-300.fc29.x86_64 |


Scenario: run `dnf upgrade` when installonly_limit not reached
  Given I use the repository "dnf-ci-fedora-updates"
   When I execute dnf with args "upgrade"
   Then the exit code is 0
    And Transaction is following
        | Action        | Package                               |
        | install       | kernel-core-0:4.19.15-300.fc29.x86_64 |
        | unchanged     | kernel-core-0:4.18.16-300.fc29.x86_64 |
