gpg-checksum.feature
====================

Skipped checking file "/var/cache/dnf/expired_repos.json" after fail to install
package with incorrect checksum. A repo is probably appended to the file only
if it's not local, so we should add this when we make tests for non-local
repositories.

deplist-1.feature
=================

Originally this feature contained two more scenarios, which are not 
available in turbo version:
1. run yum instead of dnf (this depends on having yum compatible package
   installed)
   introduced by commit a9f62ed2
2. run "sh -c 'dnf repoquery --deplist TestA'" - in fact, I'm not sure
   what this test was supposed to test.
   introduced by commit cac5697e

group-2.feature
===============

Missing testing --assumeno when installing a group. Is that necessary?

history-update.feature
======================

Dnf is not able to rollback the very first transaction in history. Needs
investigation / fix.

rich-dependencies.feature
=========================

Docker tests used rpm to install some of the packages. Does it matter?
rich-8.feature - I didn't get why it exists

module-list-1.feature
=====================

Skipped strange test I can see only modules' packages, not modules themselves in the output of 'dnf list'

common/dnf.py
=============
ugly hack
line = re.sub(r'(x86_64|noarch)(?! )', r'\1 ', line)
as workaround of missing space between arch and version in transaction table. Seen in module-install.feature
transaction table could contain an empty line - bug in dnf. When installing
multiple module profiles, they are separated by empty line
I'm not able to reproduce any of previous bugs outside of the behave environment.

module-info.feature
===================
There is likely a bug (typo) in dnf output of "dnf module info nodejs"
on the last line: "Hint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled, [a]ctive]"
There is additional square bracket ] at the end.
